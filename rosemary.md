## A little about my page:
I started this REU on 05.21.2024
Throughout my time here my goal is to update every 1-2 days and share my progess, setbacks, and thoughts that i've had along the way. 

## May 21st - May 24th
My first day was on Tuesday May 21st and my first tasks were:
1. Set up Anaconda Python
2. Set up Visual Studio Code
3. Have our GitHub ready for use
4. Document my steps for my teammate arriving later on
5. Read _Connor's Thesis_ to get a better idea and understand what the goals of the research project are
6. Familiarize myself with Pandas to make data analysis easier later down the road

After I had my environment setup, I spent time understanding the raw data connor had collected for his thesis and looking through his code to further understand his work. 

## May 28st - May 31th
The second week we decided I was prepared to focus on our sensors!!

##### Purple Air:
Our team started by making two API keys (read & write) with Purple air. We then set up our first two sensors in our workplace on the second floor of Sprauge to test out data collection, using the new API, and overall just practice working with them. 

Later on this week we met Professor Hawkins and she had introduced us to the rest of the sensors Connor used for his thesis. We created a group to track all of them at once
**At this point we had 8 Purple Air sensors** 
* HMC Jacobs 1
* HMC Jacobs 2
* HMC Jacobs 3
* HMC Jacobs 4
* HMC Jacobs 5
* HMC Jacobs 6
* Sprauge: floor 2
* SpragueFloor2

Check out the sensors on the map!--> **https://map.purpleair.com/1/mAQI/a10/p604800/cC0#16.9/34.105133/-117.712128**

To make sure they were working we decided to test their collection by making a simple plot showing how humidity and temperature values on different sensors relate to each other. (important in Connors thesis)

From this plot we decided that one of our sensors (grey HMC Jacobs 1) was not working properly ᴖ̈ so we will not be using it for our data collection period.


##### QuantAQ:
Dominick focused on this sensor more!

## June 1st - june 10th
During week 3 and 4, we were posed with a bunch of tricky problems and situations that we had to work around. 
We took our first field trip to the roof of Jacob's and got to see the senors, how they are connected, and what is missing to have them working fully. Professor Hawkins was able to get the mass spectrometer up and running for us.

While all of this was going on, we had decided to also start uploading any important code that we had made to a github repository to make sure we would both have access when it came to actually working with our data later on. Other housekeeping tasks included filling our necessary paper work for our mentee that its coming in on June 24th! 

##### Purple Air API limit Reached
We ended up reaching the maximum 'free' API calls so we had to contact support to remove that blockage for us since we own the sensors. This took a few days. 

While we figured this out, we also took the chance to ask the support team how we could fix the Purple Air sensor since it was not giving correct readings for tempreature and humidity. (will keep updating...)

##### Rasberry pi!
The initial problem with our Rasberry Pi is that the connection was not working well to
