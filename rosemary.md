## A little about my page:
I started this REU on 05.21.2024
Throughout my time here my goal is to update every 1-2 days and share my progess, setbacks, and thoughts that i've had along the way. 

## May 21st - May 24th
My first day was on Tuesday May 21st and my first tasks were:
1.Set up Anaconda Python
2.Set up Visual Studio Code
3. Have our GitHub ready for use
4. Document my steps for my teammate arriving later on
5. Read _Connor's Thesis_ to get a better idea and understand what the goals of the research project are
